### motivation

so recently I have taken a new way to take notes for my graduate level classes. for the longest time i was a staunch believer in writing down using pen and paper the whole knowledge bank that I wanted for a subject -- however in the age of such good open source tools and knowledge management software , I have gradually turned to better solutions that can help me ease and manage my note taking in a much better way.

so i have been using obsidian for quite some time now and honestly i love it.

but the main problem that I am facing is that there is no single good extension to summarize and infer insights from my own knowledge base and notes.

### solution

i am building knowl, which is a local RAG based service that provides insights for your notes and writeups in a much more succint way , rather than just deep linkages and tag based directed graphs.

i plan to soon open source it for v0.1; [knowl](https://github.com/sagnikc395/knowl)
